            <p>Welcome to Wasteland!</p>
            <div>Fallout is a series of post-apocalyptic role-playing video games—and later action role-playing
                games—created by Interplay Entertainment. The series is set during the 21st, 22nd and 23rd centuries,
                and its atompunk retrofuturistic setting and art work are influenced by the post-war culture of 1950s
                United States, with its combination of hope for the promises of technology and the lurking fear of
                nuclear annihilation. A forerunner of Fallout is Wasteland, a 1988 game developed by Interplay
                Productions to which the series is regarded as a spiritual successor.</div>
